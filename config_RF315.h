  OpenMQTTGateway  - ESP8266 or Arduino program for home automation 

   Act as a wifi or ethernet gateway between your 433mhz/infrared IR signal  and a MQTT broker 
   Send and receiving command by MQTT
 
   This files enables to set your parameter for the radiofrequency gateways (ZgatewayRF315 ) with RCswitch  library
