/*  
  OpenMQTTGateway  - ESP8266 or Arduino program for home automation 

   Act as a wifi or ethernet gateway between your 433mhz/infrared IR signal  and a MQTT broker 
   Send and receiving command by MQTT
 
  This program enables to:
 - receive MQTT data from a topic and send RF 433Mhz signal corresponding to the received MQTT data
 - publish MQTT data to a different topic related to received 433Mhz signal
 - receive MQTT data from a topic and send IR signal corresponding to the received MQTT data
 - publish MQTT data to a different topic related to received IR signal
 - publish MQTT data to a different topic related to BLE devices rssi signal
